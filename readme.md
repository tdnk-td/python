# Relearning and Revising Python

Using https://www.boot.dev/ to help me relearn & revise my Python knowledge

I will be using the guest version and update my own submissions/work here, 
as there is a certain point the guest version will not accept submissions

From Chapter 1 - 3 will offer solutions, however membership is required for Chapters afterwards
